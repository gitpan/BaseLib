Revision history for Perl extension BaseLib.

0.05 Wed Oct 23 12:05:17 UTC 2002
    - Scripts can now use their own global variable to hold the basedir
    - A dash ("-") can be used to indicate default path for LIBDIR
    - So let me state again: there's `docs' directory contains discussions
      in local perl group, and shows the reasons and examples on using
      BaseLib

    - made sure that the BASEDIR argument is looked up as
      a directory name
    - called lib.pm only if the path to the lib dir isn't in @INC yet
    - updated the documentation, primarily the section on CAVEAT

    - since I use so many croak()'s, I provide my own
      private croak() routine as front end to Carp::croak().
    - uses lib.pm to actually manipulate @INC.
    - base directory name is now mandatory
